If you have plants in your garden that are struggling, don’t let that get you down. Even experienced gardeners will have plants in their garden with problems. Quickly identifying and managing problems is what counts, not expecting everything to grow perfectly. The key is to be observant: spend just a few minutes walking through your garden every day to look for signs of trouble. Once you’ve spotted a problem, summon your inner garden detective- and read on to learn about some of the most common garden conundrums!

### Plant wilting

Plant wilting can be a sign of trouble, but not always. On hot days, many plants naturally wilt as a way of preserving themselves through the heat. So how can you tell if your plant is truly suffering or just beating the heat? The first clue is the weather- if the plant is wilting when it's not hot and sunny out, there’s likely something else afoot. Do the “finger test”- stick your finger a couple inches into the soil, and if the soil feels bone-dry then your plant needs watering ASAP. If the soil feels wet, it’s possible that the plant is wilting from _overwatering_. In this case, ease up on watering and if you’re growing in containers make sure they have good drainage. If the soil feels just nicely moist- not too dry and not too wet- hold off to see if the plant bounces back on its own overnight. If it does, it was likely just protecting itself from the heat of the day. If it doesn’t, further investigation is needed. Check for any signs of damage to the plant, especially along the stem. For example- squash vine borers can cause your squash plants to wilt as they burrow into the stems. If you spot the hole in the stem you can try to remove the borer inside with a pointy knife, then attempt to bury another spot further along the vine- with any luck it will develop new roots. There are also diseases that can cause wilt- such as verticillium wilt or fusarium wilt. These are usually not treatable; once they are identified it’s best to remove the plants.

### Discolored leaves

While plant leaves naturally come in many variations of green, if they start to turn atypically yellow, brown, purple, or white, that is a clue that the plant might be in trouble.

**Yellow leaves** can be a sign of underwatering or over watering (the ol’ under/over watering dilemma strikes again), or a lack of nitrogen. To sort out which it is, think about how much rainfall there’s been, how much you’ve been watering (do the ‘finger test’ again), and when you last fertilized. One cause should stand out as being more likely than the others. Or, sometimes plant problems come in tandem- for example, excessive rain or watering can both waterlog plants and cause nitrogen to leach away. Try to resolve the most likely culprit first - either change up your watering habits, or give the plant some nitrogen-rich fertilizer (be careful not to overdo it if using synthetic fertilizer, though, or you risk burning the plant).

**Brown leaves** are commonly a sign of underwatering (or, over-watering…again!), or over-fertilizing. Bump up your watering if you think the plant is thirsty, or to help flush away excess fertilizer. If overwatering is the likely cause, scale back on watering and again check the drainage if you are growing in containers. Some diseases can cause leaf browning too so if you suspect that the issue is not water or fertilizer, or if there are other unusual spots or markings on the leaves, start researching the specific browning pattern you are seeing to identify the potential disease.

**Leaves turning purple** can be a sign of a phosphorus deficiency - in this case, apply a fertilizer that contains phosphorus.

And if the leaves have a new **powdery white coating** that was not there before, a common cause is powdery mildew. Powdery mildew cannot be cured once it sets in; it can only be managed. Look for a [powdery mildew spray](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=powdery+mildew+spray)- or find a recipe to make your own- to help contain the problem.

### Holes in leaves, damaged or ‘mottled’ leaves

Seeing damaged leaves or mottled leaves are usually a sign of pests feasting on your plants. The trick is to identify _which_ pest is doing the deed.

Inspect the plant thoroughly for insects- oftentimes they will be clinging onto the undersides of the leaves or hiding in the canopy. Getting eyes on the pest will make it much easier to identify them and research potential solutions.

Another technique if you can’t catch the offender in the act is to look at the damage pattern. Mottled leaves are often a sign of aphids, whereas trails being chewed through leaves are a telltale sign of leaf miners. If you wake up every morning to find new holes in your plants that were not there the day before, the culprit is likely slugs who only come out at night. And if your plants are regularly being mowed down, it could be rabbits having a munch.
