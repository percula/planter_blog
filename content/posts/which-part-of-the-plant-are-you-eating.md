The fruits and vegetables you can eat come from unique parts of their plants. In your everyday life you eat everything from the roots to stems to leaves. Some angiosperms, or flowering plants, yield fruit. Though some of the things you may think of as “fruits” aren’t truly fruit as we expect. Conversely, some plant parts we consider “vegetables” are actually botanically fruits. In some circumstances you eat parts of a plant that contain other parts that are actually inedible. Understanding the variety of plant parts you can and can’t eat is an important part of gardening, and if you’re anything like me, you’ll find the variety of plant parts we can eat pretty fascinating.
