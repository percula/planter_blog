Do you live in an apartment or a home without a yard? It’s easy to think of gardening as an activity of homeowners with plenty of yard space. But no matter where you are living, gardening is something you can dabble in. Your gardening options include growing plants that can survive and mature indoors or adding containers to your porch and creating a compact garden space. Additionally, community gardens are perfect if you want to grow a wider array of plants.

### **Patio gardening:**

If you have a patio or porch, you’ll be happy to know that you still have plenty of opportunities to start gardening. Containers are great to place on your patio or porch, allowing you to have delicious plants without the time or space needed for a backyard garden. Growing your plants in containers can even make it easier to spot and pluck weeds \[3\]. In terms of container size, depending on the plants you’re looking to grow the size can vary. For certain greens like kale and spinach, as well as smaller tomatoes a 1-2 gallon well draining pot will be sufficient. So if space is an issue, stick to greens!

**Kale:** Of the greens you can grow in small containers, kale is a relatively easy option and it is frost tolerant! Start seeds indoors about 6 weeks before your last frost, and then transplant to your chosen container. Water when the top inch of soil is dry, fertilize every other week, and allow for 8 hours of sunlight \[8\].

**Tomatoes:** Patio varieties of tomatoes can be purchased and grown in your porch containers \[4\]. Grow tomatoes with full sun, and larger varieties should also have larger containers. Consider adding a tomato cage for vines to grow and have support on \[3\].

**Lettuce:** If your patio doesn’t receive full sun, consider planting lettuce in your containers, as this plant does not require as much light as other plants \[3\].

**Peas:** Peas can be grown at the beginning of the season in a container, and then swapped out for another plant later in the season if you’re looking for some variety while not using too many containers \[3\].

Some other plants that can be grown in containers on your porch include squash, hot peppers, arugula, and eggplant \[3\].
